# C++ Basic Functions Project

This repository contains a project focused on **basic C++ functions**.  
The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of core C++ concepts such as functions, parameters, return values, and basic logic.

The code is written for learning and practice purposes as part of my software engineering studies.
